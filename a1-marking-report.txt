STYLE AND COMMENTS: [/16]

   * Easy to read, appropriate layout, lines aren't too long, blank
     lines delineating blocks of code functionality. (Basically 
     does it look good and is easy to read.)  [/3]

   * Blocks of code commented. Is it clear what functionality each
     block of code is responsible for? Is it clear what variables are
     being used for?   [/3]

   * Code is decomposed into methods. There shouldn't be long 
     blocks of code or repeated code. [/3]

   * Regular use of git to push changes to stash. [ /2]

   * Marker's discretion   [/5]
