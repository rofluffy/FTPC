CLIENT - FUNCTIONALITY: [44/55]

Working makefile produces the CSftp.jar file 		[1/2]
*There are a number of java files. Should change the dependency
*of CSftp.jar accordingly.
  
Open Command                                            [ /6]    
    - Accepts server names in both IP and                         
       domain name format                                        
    - Proper port processing (uses port 21                       
       if no port # supplied)                                    
    - If there is command connection open, reports a 803         

User command                                           [2/7]
     - Command is rejected if no connection established          
     - Command rejected if no USERNAME paramater provided        *Not handled        
     - Sends USER command to server                              
     - Process response indicating password required             
       (2 marks)
     - Properly handles rejected request
       *When the reponse was "530 Login incorrect", the program issued no error message.
       *Should issue "899 Processing error. Login incorrect." instead
       *and should not close the connection socket because after this, the program should
       *handle "user" or "user username". However the program displayed a wrong message of
       *"800 Invalid command." for either of the two "user command"     
     - Properly deals with case when no password required
       *In the file CSftp.java, a quick-fix has been applied to this program by marking out line 208
       *to 209. Replace line 207 with System.out.println("899 Processing error. Login incorrect.");
       *For the "user command", modify login() as login(String user).
       *At line 166, add "if (user.equals("")) {" and 
       *replace line 168 with "user = userInput.readLine(); }"
       *Replace line 151 with "login("");" Then at line 63, add case "user", handle 801,
       *add "username = input[1]; login(username);"  Declare username in main.
       *Part marks are given for the codes in login().     

Quit command                                          [ /3]      
     - Closes open connections and exits,                         
     - Sends QUIT on the control connection.                     
     - If no open connection just exits                          

Close command
      - closes the open control connection           [ /2]       
      - new prompt                                               

Cd command                                            [1/2]

STYLE AND COMMENTS: [/16]

   * Easy to read, appropriate layout, lines aren't too long, blank
     lines delineating blocks of code functionality. (Basically 
     does it look good and is easy to read.)  [/3]               

   * Blocks of code commented. Is it clear what functionality each
     block of code is responsible for? Is it clear what variables are
     being used for?   [/3]                                      

   * Code is decomposed into methods. There shouldn't be long 
     blocks of code or repeated code. [/3]                       

   * Regular use of git to push changes to stash. [ /2]          

   * Marker's discretion   [/5]
